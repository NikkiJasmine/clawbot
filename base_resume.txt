PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
I'm a strategic and collaborative content and marketing specialist with over six years of experience across affiliate, influencer, and social campaigns in Europe and North America. I’ve worked with teams supporting brands like Essity, Ericsson, and Old Spice, where our shared efforts helped increase newsletter subscribers by 32.7% and improve engagement by 18.3%. I often take the lead on organizing and keeping projects moving, especially when things need clarity or calm structure. I’m experienced in partner outreach, creator research, affiliate tracking, and campaign reporting. Based in Stockholm for over eight years with an EU passport, and originally from Canada, I care deeply about accessibility, inclusion, and building digital stories that work across cultures.
