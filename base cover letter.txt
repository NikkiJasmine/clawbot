Hej,

I’m writing to apply for content, marketing, and communication roles where clear teamwork, structure, and good communication are important. I have over six years of experience supporting social, influencer, and affiliate campaigns in Europe and North America. I enjoy working in roles where content helps people understand ideas clearly and where teams work together in a calm and organized way.

I found my way into content and marketing by working closely with different teams across many projects. Over time, I learned how important clear language, good structure, and shared responsibility are for both internal work and external communication. I enjoy being part of teams where people support each other and where work moves forward steadily, without unnecessary pressure.

In my work, I’ve supported many parts of the campaign and content production. This includes planning support, creator research, outreach coordination, affiliate tracking, and reporting. In one project, this work helped increase newsletter subscribers by 32.7% and improve engagement by 18.3%. I’ve also supported influencer campaigns and contributed to a Webby Award–winning newsletter. I usually work closely with writers, designers, and editors to help keep content organized and consistent.

I work best when I can support both planning and execution. I enjoy helping turn ideas into clear next steps and supporting teams with structure when projects are moving quickly. Whether I’m helping with content calendars, localization work, or campaign coordination, I focus on clarity, follow-through, and good collaboration.

I’m especially interested in roles where content is used across different countries, platforms, and audiences. Having worked with teams in both Europe and North America, I’m comfortable adjusting tone and messaging while keeping the main message clear. I value open communication and working together to improve ideas over time.

I have lived in Sweden since 2017 and am currently based in Sundbyberg, Stockholm. I have the right to work in Sweden and am fully settled here. I appreciate Swedish work culture, especially the focus on teamwork, trust, balance, and clear communication, and I try to bring these values into my daily work.

Jag studerar svenska och är på A2-nivå. Jag övar varje dag och försöker använda språket så mycket som möjligt i vardagen och på jobbet. Jag ser fram emot att fortsätta utveckla min svenska över tid.

I would be happy to support a team where content and communication help both people and projects work better, and where steady, thoughtful work is valued.

Med vänliga hälsningar,  

Nicole Scott
